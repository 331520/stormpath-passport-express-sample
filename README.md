# stormpath-passport-express-sample

A sample Passport + Express application which demonstrates how to successfully use
[passport-stormpath](https://github.com/stormpath/passport-stormpath) to handle
user authentication and authorization for your web app.

[Stormpath](http://stormpath.com/) is a User Management API that reduces development time for any application with scalable user infrastructure. 

**NOTE**: If you're building an Express.js web application, you might want to
use our [express-stormpath](https://docs.stormpath.com/nodejs/express/index.html)
library instead -- it provides a simpler integration experience.
